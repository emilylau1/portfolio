Hi there! I'm Emily, and I am an aspiring data scientist. I am studying applied economics and management @ Cornell University and am super interested in business analytics and data science. I am currently learning Python and SQL. Check out some data projects I've completed. 

# [The World Bank's International Debt](https://github.com/emilylau1/portfolio/tree/42e6f11036ee037c2c9ae1d404b74af9cb5dacdd/Analyze%20International%20Debt)
In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. I was interested in finding out the total amount of debt that is owed by all countries and the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators. Furthermore, I discovered the most common types of debt that are owed to better understand each country's economic situation. This project was completed in SQL using DataCamp and Jupyter Notebook.
