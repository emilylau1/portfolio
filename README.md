Hi there! I'm Emily, and I am an aspiring data scientist. I am studying applied economics and management @ Cornell University and am super interested in business analytics and data science. I am currently learning Python and SQL. Check out some data projects I've completed. 

# [The World Bank's International Debt](https://github.com/emilylau1/portfolio/tree/42e6f11036ee037c2c9ae1d404b74af9cb5dacdd/Analyze%20International%20Debt)
In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. I was interested in finding out the total amount of debt that is owed by all countries and the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators. Furthermore, I discovered the most common types of debt that are owed to better understand each country's economic situation. This project was completed in SQL using DataCamp and Jupyter Notebook.

# When Was The Golden Age of Video Games?
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I wanted to determine the year(s) in which video games were both loved by critics and had the highest gross sales. This project was completed in SQL using DataCamp and Jupyter Notebook.
